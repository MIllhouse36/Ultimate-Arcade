## Description: 
Users can log into an account and have the option to pick a game.  Instead of closing applications and reloading new applications, users can simply return to the game gallery and select a new game to play.

New games would be added on some time interval set basis.  For example, every month we would strive to add a new game to the portal.
As the application matures and user registration increases, future development would include the users ability to actively participate or providing feedback on new features, new games and enhancements they would like added.  This would keep users engaged, returning to the application and potentially draw new users as the option grow.    

Gaming customization/ user participation in the design process is a big part of todayâ€™s console environment.  The goal of this future development is to provide a similar experience.
